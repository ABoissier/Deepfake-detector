Building a MesoNet4 network &amp; deploying it online

## Context 

Deepfakes have become a growing issue, especially with the development of more robust **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. Altough GANs were first introduced in 2014 [[1]](#1), the recent advances in computer vision have allowed them to create synthetic images and videos of celebrities or politicians.

The use of deepfakes in fake news, hoaxes and even financial fraud have garnered, much needed attention, both politically and academically, to try to limit their use and propagation.
